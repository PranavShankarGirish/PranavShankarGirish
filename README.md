# 👋 Hi there!

I'm Pranav, a master’s student at MIT, focusing on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Optimization. I’m passionate about using these skills to develop smart, adaptive decision-making systems for today's fast-paced world. My background is in operations research from IIT Delhi, where I also explored mathematical modeling and management consulting. I’ve worked across numerous sectors including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and tech, and I'm especially excited about the possibilities Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning hold for transforming how we solve problems and make decisions.

## 🎓 Education

- **Master of Business Analytics** at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating Aug 2024 (GPA: 5.0/5.0)
- **Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering** at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (May 2023)

## 💼 Current Positions

- **Data Science Intern** at Accenture Research (MIT Capstone Project)
- **Graduate Research Assistant** at MIT Operations Research Center

👨🏻‍💻 My capstone project at Accenture Research is focused on exploring the "future of work". To be less vague, we are developing a system that enables companies to better navigate the impact of Generative AI on the composition of their workforce, maximizing productivity while maintaining low displacement through optimized reskilling initiatives.

Here are some of my **recent projects** that I am happy to share:
